# Sudoku-Solver
Sudoku-Solver is a logic-based number puzzle which involves creating a program capable of solving Sudoku puzzles of varying levels of complexity.

Overview: Sudoku Solver is a classic logic-based number puzzle that involves filling a 9x9 grid with numbers (typically 1 to 9) so that each row, each column, and each of the nine 3x3 subgrids (also known as "regions") contains all the digits from 1 to 9 without repetition. The goal of this project is to create a program that can solve Sudoku puzzles of varying levels of complexity using logical reasoning and algorithms.

Project Objectives:
The main objectives of the Sudoku Solver project are as follows:

1. User Interface: Develop a user-friendly interface for users to input Sudoku puzzles they want to solve. Display the solved puzzle to the user.
2. Puzzle Representation: Create a data structure to represent the Sudoku puzzle grid, which includes 9 rows, 9 columns, and 9 regions. Implement a method to initialize the puzzle grid with the given clues.
3. Solving Algorithms: Implement logic-based solving algorithms to fill in the puzzle grid. Some common algorithms used in Sudoku solving include:
* Single Candidate
* Hidden Singles
* Naked Pairs/Triples
* X-Wing
* Swordfish
* Backtracking (for more complex puzzles)
4. User Input: Allow users to input Sudoku puzzles in various formats, such as manual entry, copy-paste, or importing from a file.
5. Error Handling: Validate user input to ensure it is a valid Sudoku puzzle (i.e., follows the rules of Sudoku). Handle and report errors gracefully.
6. Difficulty Levels: Implement the ability to specify the difficulty level of the puzzle to be solved. Support puzzles ranging from easy to very difficult.
7. Puzzle Generator (optional): Optionally, include a puzzle generator that can create Sudoku puzzles with unique solutions.
8. User Assistance: Provide users with the option to receive hints or step-by-step solving guidance if they are stuck.
9. Performance Optimization: Optimize the solving algorithms for efficiency, especially for complex puzzles.
10. User Feedback: Gather user feedback and continuously improve the solver's usability and performance.
11. Documentation: Create comprehensive documentation explaining how to use the Sudoku Solver, its features, and any technical details.
12. Testing and Validation: Thoroughly test the Sudoku Solver with a variety of puzzles to ensure accuracy and reliability.
13. User Experience: Focus on creating a smooth and intuitive user experience, with clear instructions and responsive design.

Project Deliverables:
The project deliverables include the following:

1. A Sudoku Solver application with a user-friendly interface.
2. Documentation that explains how to use the solver and any technical details.
3. Source code with appropriate comments and documentation.
4. A testing plan and test cases to validate the solver's functionality.
5. User feedback and improvements based on user testing.

Key components and technical details of the Sudoku Solver project:

1. Puzzle Representation: The Sudoku grid can be represented using a 2D array or matrix, where each cell corresponds to a row and column in the puzzle. A value of 0 or an empty cell typically represents an unknown or unfilled cell.
2. Solving Algorithms: Single Candidate: This algorithm checks each empty cell and fills it if there's only one possible candidate based on the numbers in the same row, column, and region.
3. Hidden Singles: Identify hidden singles in rows, columns, and regions by looking for numbers that can only appear in one cell within a particular unit.
4. Naked Pairs/Triples: Find sets of cells within a unit (row, column, or region) where only the same two or three numbers are candidates. These cells can be solved accordingly.
5. X-Wing, Swordfish, etc.: More advanced solving techniques involve pattern recognition across rows and columns to eliminate candidates.
6. Backtracking: If the logical solving algorithms can't make further progress, a backtracking algorithm can be employed. This involves making a guess, filling in a cell, and then recursively attempting to solve the puzzle until either a solution is found or a contradiction arises. If a contradiction is encountered, the solver backtracks to the previous guess and explores other possibilities.
7. User Interface: The user interface can be created using a GUI library or framework such as Tkinter (for Python), JavaFX (for Java), or any other suitable choice. It should provide a grid for inputting the initial puzzle, buttons for solving, clearing, and providing hints, and an area to display the solved puzzle.
8. Input Validation: Validate user input to ensure that it adheres to Sudoku rules (no duplicate numbers in rows, columns, or regions) and that it's a solvable puzzle.
9. Difficulty Levels: Implement different strategies for selecting and generating puzzles of varying difficulties. The difficulty can be determined by the number of initial clues provided.
10. Puzzle Generator (optional): If you decide to include a puzzle generator, it should be able to create puzzles with a unique solution. Generating puzzles can involve a combination of solving and randomizing techniques.
11. User Assistance: For user assistance, provide options like highlighting possible candidates, highlighting errors, or giving step-by-step solving hints.
12. Performance Optimization: Optimize the solving algorithms, especially for larger or more complex puzzles, to ensure that the solver can handle them efficiently.
13. Testing and Validation: Develop a suite of test cases that cover various aspects of puzzle solving, including easy and hard puzzles, edge cases, and invalid inputs. Conduct thorough testing to ensure the solver works correctly and efficiently.
14. User Experience: Design an intuitive and responsive user interface with clear instructions and error messages. Implement features such as saving and loading puzzles.
15. Documentation: Create user documentation that explains how to use the solver, its features, and any technical details. Provide developer documentation if you intend to make the source code available to others.
16. User Feedback: Gather feedback from users to identify areas for improvement, bug fixes, and feature requests.
17. Deployment: Depending on your project goals, you can deploy the Sudoku Solver as a standalone desktop application, a web application, or even a mobile app.
